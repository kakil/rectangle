# Create Rectangle Class

## Project Brief
Today we will practice object-oriented programming. Imagine you are developing 
a civil engineering application (e.g., AutoCAD) with Python. Your current task 
is to create a Python class that represents a rectangle geometrical figure. 
The Rectangle class should:

Two instance attributes, width, and height.
An area() method that returns the area of the rectangle.
A perimeter() method that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
An is_square() method that returns True if the rectangle is a square and 
False (or None) if it is not.

## Expected Output
Your task is to simply define the class. You donâ€™t need to call the class.
