# Create Rectangle Class

## Project Brief - Part 1
Today we will practice object-oriented programming. Imagine you are developing 
a civil engineering application (e.g., AutoCAD) with Python. Your current task 
is to create a Python class that represents a rectangle geometrical figure. 
The Rectangle class should:

Two instance attributes, width, and height.
An area() method that returns the area of the rectangle.
A perimeter() method that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
An is_square() method that returns True if the rectangle is a square and 
False (or None) if it is not.

### Expected Output - Part 1
Your task is to simply define the class. You don’t need to call the class.

## Project Brief - Part 2
Yesterday, we coded a Rectangle class that had a width and a height attribute. The class also had an area(), perimeter(), and an is_square() method.

Your task for today is to add two magic methods to that class 
__str__ and __eq__. The __str__ method should return a string 
representation of the Rectangle and __eq__ should enable comparing 
two different rectangle instances returning True or False based on 
whether the rectangles are similar or not (i.e., have the same width 
and height).

### Expected Output - Part 2
Your task is to simply define the class. You don’t need to call the class.
